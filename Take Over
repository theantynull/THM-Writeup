Room: Take over ( Try Hack Me )

Hello there,

I am the CEO and one of the co-founders of futurevera.thm. In Futurevera, we believe that the future is in space. We do a lot of space research and write blogs about it.
We used to help students with space questions, but we are rebuilding our support. 
Recently blackhat hackers approached us saying they could takeover and are asking us for a big ransom. Please help us to find what they can takeover.
Our website is located at https://futurevera.thm
